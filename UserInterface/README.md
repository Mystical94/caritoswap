## CaritoSwap Interface

An open source interface for CaritoSwap -- a protocol for decentralized exchange on Celo.

Enabling users to:

- Add and remove their liquidity positions on CaritoSwap protocol
- Swap tokens on CaritoSwap protocol

Future Plans:

- Add the functinality of Farming, Staking and Limit Orders
- Making it live on the Celo Blockchain (coming very soon 😉)
